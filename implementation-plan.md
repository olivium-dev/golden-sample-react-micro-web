# üöÄ Micro-Frontend Implementation Plan

This document provides a step-by-step implementation plan for building the micro-frontend golden sample with React and Webpack Module Federation.

---

## üìã Phase 1: Project Setup & Architecture

### Repository Structure Setup
- [ ] **Decision: Choose repository strategy**
  - [ ] Option A: Multiple repositories (one per app)
  - [ ] Option B: Monorepo with workspaces (Nx/Turborepo)
  - **Guidance**: Monorepo is recommended for initial development and learning

- [ ] **Create project structure**
  ```
  /container          # Main host application
  /auth-app          # Authentication micro-frontend
  /dashboard-app     # Dashboard micro-frontend
  /profile-app       # Profile micro-frontend
  /ui-lib           # Shared design system (optional)
  ```

### Development Environment
- [ ] **Install Node.js** (v16+ recommended)
- [ ] **Install package managers** (npm/yarn/pnpm)
- [ ] **Setup concurrently** for running multiple apps
- [ ] **Configure IDE** with TypeScript and React extensions

---

## üì¶ Phase 2: Container Application

### Container App Creation
- [ ] **Create React TypeScript project**
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app container --template typescript
  cd container
  ```

- [ ] **Install additional dependencies**
  ```bash
  npm install react-router-dom @types/react-router-dom
  ```

### Webpack Module Federation Setup
- [ ] **Create webpack.config.js** with Module Federation configuration
- [ ] **Configure remotes** pointing to auth, dashboard, and profile apps
- [ ] **Setup shared dependencies** (React, ReactDOM as singletons)
- [ ] **Configure development server** on port 3000

**Best Practice**: Always use singleton sharing for React to avoid version conflicts

### Routing Implementation
- [ ] **Setup React Router** in App.tsx
- [ ] **Implement lazy loading** for remote components
- [ ] **Add Suspense boundaries** with loading fallbacks
- [ ] **Create navigation component** for app-wide navigation

**Best Practice**: Use Suspense with meaningful loading states for better UX

### Error Boundaries
- [ ] **Create ErrorBoundary component** for handling remote app failures
- [ ] **Implement fallback UI** for when remote apps fail to load
- [ ] **Add retry mechanisms** for failed remote loads

---

## üîê Phase 3: Authentication Remote App

### Auth App Creation
- [ ] **Create React TypeScript project**
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app auth-app --template typescript
  cd auth-app
  ```

### Module Federation Configuration
- [ ] **Create webpack.config.js** with Module Federation
- [ ] **Configure app name** as "auth"
- [ ] **Expose AuthPage component** via "./AuthPage"
- [ ] **Setup shared dependencies** matching container
- [ ] **Configure development server** on port 3001

### Authentication Features
- [ ] **Create login form component**
- [ ] **Create registration form component**
- [ ] **Implement form validation**
- [ ] **Add authentication state management**
- [ ] **Create AuthPage as main export**

**Best Practice**: Keep auth logic minimal in remote, delegate to container for global state

---

## üìä Phase 4: Dashboard Remote App

### Dashboard App Creation
- [ ] **Create React TypeScript project**
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app dashboard-app --template typescript
  cd dashboard-app
  ```

### Module Federation Configuration
- [ ] **Create webpack.config.js** with Module Federation
- [ ] **Configure app name** as "dashboard"
- [ ] **Expose DashboardPage component** via "./DashboardPage"
- [ ] **Setup shared dependencies** matching container
- [ ] **Configure development server** on port 3002

### Dashboard Features
- [ ] **Create dashboard layout component**
- [ ] **Add sample widgets/cards**
- [ ] **Implement data visualization** (charts, graphs)
- [ ] **Create DashboardPage as main export**

---

## üë§ Phase 5: Profile Remote App

### Profile App Creation
- [ ] **Create React TypeScript project**
  ```bash
  npx create-react-app profile-app --template typescript
  cd profile-app
  ```

### Module Federation Configuration
- [ ] **Create webpack.config.js** with Module Federation
- [ ] **Configure app name** as "profile"
- [ ] **Expose ProfilePage component** via "./ProfilePage"
- [ ] **Setup shared dependencies** matching container
- [ ] **Configure development server** on port 3003

### Profile Features
- [ ] **Create user profile form**
- [ ] **Add profile image upload**
- [ ] **Implement profile settings**
- [ ] **Create ProfilePage as main export**

---

## üé® Phase 6: Shared UI Library (Optional but Recommended)

### UI Library Setup
- [ ] **Create shared UI package**
- [ ] **Setup build configuration** for library
- [ ] **Create design tokens** (colors, typography, spacing)
- [ ] **Implement common components** (Button, Input, Card, etc.)

### Integration
- [ ] **Publish UI library** (npm/private registry)
- [ ] **Install in all apps**
- [ ] **Update components** to use shared UI library
- [ ] **Ensure consistent styling** across all apps

**Best Practice**: Version your UI library and use semantic versioning

---

## üîÑ Phase 7: State Management & Communication

### Global State Setup
- [ ] **Choose state management solution** (Redux Toolkit/Zustand/Context)
- [ ] **Setup global store** in container
- [ ] **Create state slices** for auth, user data, etc.
- [ ] **Implement state persistence** if needed

### Inter-App Communication
- [ ] **Setup event bus** for cross-app communication
- [ ] **Implement custom events** for app-to-app messaging
- [ ] **Create shared context providers**
- [ ] **Document communication patterns**

**Best Practice**: Keep state in container, pass data to remotes via props/context

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Phase 8: Development Workflow

### Local Development
- [ ] **Create package.json scripts** for running all apps
- [ ] **Setup concurrently configuration**
  ```bash
  npm install -g concurrently
  ```
- [ ] **Create start script** to run all apps simultaneously
- [ ] **Test hot reloading** across all applications

---

## üöÄ Phase 9: Production Build & Deployment

### Build Configuration
- [ ] **Configure production webpack** for each app
- [ ] **Optimize bundle sizes** and enable tree shaking

- [ ] **Configure asset optimization** (images, fonts)

### Deployment Strategy
- [ ] **Setup CI/CD pipelines** for each app independently
- [ ] **Configure CDN deployment** for remote entries
- [ ] **Setup environment-specific** remote URLs
- [ ] **Implement blue-green deployment** strategy

### Production URLs
- [ ] **Deploy container** to main domain
- [ ] **Deploy auth app** to CDN (e.g., `https://cdn.myapp.com/auth/`)
- [ ] **Deploy dashboard app** to CDN (e.g., `https://cdn.myapp.com/dashboard/`)
- [ ] **Deploy profile app** to CDN (e.g., `https://cdn.myapp.com/profile/`)

**Best Practice**: Use versioned deployments and implement rollback strategies

- [ ] **Error boundaries** gracefully handle failures
- [ ] **Production deployment** works with independent CI/CD
- [ ] **Performance metrics** meet acceptable thresholds
- [ ] **Documentation** is complete and up-to-date

---

## üö® Common Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Version Conflicts**: Always use singleton sharing for React/ReactDOM
2. **CORS Issues**: Ensure proper CORS configuration for remote entries
3. **Bundle Size**: Monitor shared dependencies to avoid duplication
4. **Error Handling**: Always implement proper error boundaries
5. **State Management**: Avoid tight coupling between remote apps
6. **Deployment Order**: Container should be deployed after remotes
7. **Network Failures**: Implement retry logic for remote loading
8. **TypeScript Issues**: Ensure proper type definitions for remote modules
