## 🎮 Quick Commands

### Start All Services
```powershell
.\run-windows.ps1
```

### Stop All Services
```powershell
.\stop-windows.ps1
```

### Check Service Status
```powershell
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000,3001,3002,3003,3004,8000 | Select-Object LocalPort, State
```

### Test Backend Health
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

---

## 📋 What's Running

### Backend Service (Port 8000)
- FastAPI application with JWT authentication
- Automatic code reload on changes
- OpenAPI documentation at `/api/docs`
- Health check at `/health`

### Frontend Services (Ports 3000-3004)
- **Container App (3000)**: Host application with navigation
- **User Management (3001)**: User CRUD operations
- **Data Grid (3002)**: Data visualization with clean architecture
- **Analytics (3003)**: Charts and analytics dashboard
- **Settings (3004)**: Configuration panel

All frontend apps use:
- Webpack 5 with Module Federation
- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
- React 18.2.0
- Material-UI 5.15+
- TypeScript

---

## 🔍 How to Use

### 1. Open the Main Application
Navigate to: **http://localhost:3000** (should be open in your browser now!)

### 2. Explore the Dashboard
You'll see a professional interface with:
- Header with user menu
- Collapsible sidebar navigation
- Dashboard with clickable module cards
- Footer with system status

### 3. Navigate Between Micro-Frontends
Click any menu item or dashboard card:
- 👥 User Management - Manage users and data
- 📊 Data Grid - View data in advanced grid
- 📈 Analytics - See charts and metrics
- ⚙️ Settings - Configure preferences
- 🐛 Error Monitor - Real-time error tracking

### 4. Each Micro-Frontend Loads Independently
- Lazy-loaded via Module Federation
- Fault-isolated with Error Boundaries
- Shared dependencies (React, MUI)

---

## 🛠️ Development Features

### Hot Reload Enabled
All services support hot reload:
- Edit any file in `frontend/` or `backend/`
- Changes automatically reflected in browser
- No need to restart services

### Error Monitoring
- Real-time error tracking
- Error panel (Ctrl+Shift+E)
- Error toast notifications
- Dedicated error monitor page

### API Documentation
Interactive API docs at: http://localhost:8000/api/docs
- Try out endpoints
- See request/response schemas
- Test authentication

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Service Won't Start?
```powershell
# Stop all services
.\stop-windows.ps1

# Wait 5 seconds, then restart
.\run-windows.ps1
```

### Port Already in Use?
```powershell
# Find process using port (e.g., 3000)
Get-NetTCPConnection -LocalPort 3000 | Select-Object OwningProcess

# Kill the process
Stop-Process -Id <ProcessID> -Force
```

### Container App Shows White Screen?
- Wait 30-60 seconds for initial compilation
- Check that all 5 services are running (ports 3000-3004 and 8000)
- Clear browser cache and refresh

### Module Federation Error?
- Ensure all micro-frontends are running
- Check that remoteEntry.js is accessible:
  - http://localhost:3001/remoteEntry.js
  - http://localhost:3002/remoteEntry.js
  - http://localhost:3003/remoteEntry.js
  - http://localhost:3004/remoteEntry.js

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Micro-Frontend Pattern
- **Container App** acts as the host
- **Remote Apps** are loaded dynamically at runtime
- **Webpack Module Federation** enables code sharing
- **No build-time coupling** between applications

### Authentication Flow
- JWT-based authentication
- Access tokens (15 minutes)
- Refresh tokens (7 days)
- Automatic token refresh
- Cross-tab synchronization

### Shared Dependencies
React, MUI, and other libraries are shared via Module Federation:
- Only loaded once (singleton)
- Reduces bundle size
- Faster page loads

---

## 📈 Next Steps

### For Development
1. **Modify Components**: Edit files in `frontend/*/src/`
2. **Add API Endpoints**: Create routers in `backend/routers/`
3. **Update Styles**: Modify MUI theme in `shared-ui-lib`
4. **Test Features**: Use the demo credentials to explore

### For Production
1. Build Docker images: `docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build`
2. Deploy containers to your infrastructure
3. Configure environment variables
4. Set up SSL/HTTPS
5. Enable security features

## 🎉 You're All Set!

**Your micro-frontend platform is fully operational!**

The main application should now be open in your browser at **http://localhost:3000**.

For questions or issues:
- Check the comprehensive README.md
- Review error logs in the PowerShell windows
- Test individual services at their URLs

**Happy coding! 🚀**
