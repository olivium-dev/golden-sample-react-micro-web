# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## One Command to Rule Them All

```bash
./run.sh
```

That's it! Wait ~60 seconds for compilation, then open: **http://localhost:3000**

---

## What Just Happened?

The `run.sh` script:
1. ✅ Stops any existing services
2. ✅ Starts FastAPI backend (port 8000)
3. ✅ Starts all 5 micro-frontends with working configs
4. ✅ Uses `webpack.minimal.js` (not the broken old configs)

---

## Access Your Apps

| App | URL | What It Does |
|-----|-----|--------------|
| **🏠 Container (Main)** | http://localhost:3000 | Navigation hub - access all apps here |
| 👥 User Management | http://localhost:3001 | CRUD operations, DataGrid |
| 📊 Data Grid | http://localhost:3002 | Clean Architecture example |
| 📈 Analytics | http://localhost:3003 | Charts and metrics |
| ⚙️ Settings | http://localhost:3004 | Theme and preferences |
| 🐍 Backend API | http://localhost:8000/docs | FastAPI documentation |

---

## Stop All Services

```bash
./stop.sh
```

---

## What's Working

✅ **All 5 micro-frontends rendering**
✅ **Container app with navigation**
✅ **MUI components everywhere**
✅ **Backend API integration**
✅ **React 18.2.0 stable**
✅ **No white screens**
✅ **No infinite error loops**

---

## Troubleshooting

### Container not loading?

```bash
# Check if it compiled
tail -20 frontend/container/container.log | grep "compiled"

# Should see: "webpack 5.102.1 compiled successfully"
```

### Still seeing white screen?

```bash
# Make sure run.sh was updated to use webpack.minimal.js
grep "webpack.minimal.js" run.sh

# You should see it in all 5 app start commands
```

### Services not starting?

```bash
# Check if ports are in use
lsof -ti:3000 3001 3002 3003 3004 8000

# Stop everything and restart
./stop.sh && ./run.sh
```

## Files You Need to Know

- `run.sh` - ✅ **FIXED** to use webpack.minimal.js
- `stop.sh` - Stop all services
- `run_minimal.sh` - Alternative startup script
- `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` - Why things broke and how we fixed them
- `FINAL_SUCCESS_REPORT.md` - Complete project report

---

## Key Insight

**The Problem:** The old `webpack.config.js` files use ErrorCapture which causes infinite loops (35k+ errors).

**The Solution:** We created `webpack.minimal.js` configs that work perfectly.

**The Fix:** Updated `run.sh` to use the minimal configs.

## Next Steps

1. **Explore the apps** - Click around in the container
2. **Test the features** - Add users, change themes, view charts
3. **Read the docs** - Check out LESSONS_LEARNED.md
4. **Customize** - It's your golden sample now!

**Status:** ✅ Fully Working  
**Last Updated:** Now!  
**Your Move:** Open http://localhost:3000 and enjoy! 🎉
